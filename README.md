# 👋 Hello there! I'm Ines 💻🏋️‍♀️

No, I'm not an AI model 🤖... but I *do* speak many languages 😄

Welcome to my GitHub!

🎓 I'm a curious and motivated tech student, always looking for ways to grow, build, and break things (in a good way).


🛠️ I'm currently studying **Software Development** with a focus on web technologies.

🌱 Building projects using C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

☁️ Currently exploring Cloud development with Azure, including services like App Services, Azure SQL, and DevOps pipelines

🏋️‍♀️ Outside of code, I'm a strength training enthusiast — fitness is my passion!

🌍 I speak **French, Arabic, Swedish**, and **English** — not just programming languages!

🔮 Fun fact: I'm on a mission to combine tech with creativity and well-being.
